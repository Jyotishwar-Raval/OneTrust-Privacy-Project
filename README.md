# OneTrust Data Privacy Consultant Simulation Project

Welcome to my **OneTrust Data Privacy Consultant** sandbox project ‚Äî a practical simulation designed to demonstrate my hands-on knowledge of privacy program implementation using OneTrust concepts and tools.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project simulates key OneTrust modules and workflows, including:

- **Data Mapping:** Mock Record of Processing Activities (RoPA) for multiple departments.
- **DSAR Workflow:** Visualized request handling from user submission to final response.
- **Consent Management:** GDPR-compliant consent policy framework.
- **Vendor Risk Management:** Third-party vendor inventory and risk assessment.
- **Assessment Automation:** Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) template for risk identification.

## üéØ Objective

To showcase the ability to design, configure, and simulate privacy workflows aligned with global data privacy regulations such as **GDPR** and **CCPA** ‚Äî reflecting the real-world responsibilities of a OneTrust Data Privacy Consultant.
